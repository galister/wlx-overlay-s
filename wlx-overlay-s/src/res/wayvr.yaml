version: 1

# If your gpu has some issues with zero-copy textures, you can set this option to "software".
#
# Possible options:
# "dmabuf": Use zero-copy texture access (from EGL to Vulkan) - no performance impact
# "software": Read pixel data to memory via glReadPixels() every time a content has been updated. Minor performance impact on large resolutions
blit_method: "dmabuf"

# Automatically close overlays with zero window count?
auto_hide: true

# For how long an overlay should be visible in case if there are no windows present? (in milliseconds, auto_hide needs to be enabled)
# This value shouldn't be set at 0, because some programs could re-initialize a window during startup (splash screens for example)
auto_hide_delay: 750

# In milliseconds
keyboard_repeat_delay: 200

# Chars per second
keyboard_repeat_rate: 50

# WayVR-compatible dashboard.
# For now, there is only one kind of dashboard with WayVR IPC support (WayVR Dashboard).

# Build instructions: https://github.com/olekolek1000/wayvr-dashboard

# exec: Executable path, for example "/home/USER/wayvr-dashboard/src-tauri/target/release/wayvr-dashboard"
# or just "wayvr-dashboard" if you have it installed from your package manager.
